  {
    question: "What is Plator and who is it built for?",
    answer:
      "Plator is a browser-native visual studio built for creators, indie makers, designers, and marketers. It lets you create device mockups, fluid animated mesh gradients, retro dither shaders, and export studio-quality 4K images and 60 FPS MP4 video loops with zero complexity.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are dither shaders and how do they work?",
    answer:
      "Dithering is a timeless visual aesthetic that renders color gradients and shadows using stylized pixel and dot-matrix patterns (like 90s cyber aesthetics and vintage displays). Plator processes these shaders live on your GPU at 60 FPS, giving your artwork an authentic retro-modern feel with instant controls.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Plator really 100% free and private?",
    answer:
      "Yes, completely. Plator runs 100% client-side directly in your browser. None of your uploaded images, compositions, or exported files are ever sent to a remote server or stored in a database. Your data never leaves your device.",
  },
  {
    question: "What export formats and resolutions are supported?",
    answer:
      "Plator supports lossless 1x, 2x Retina, and 4K UHD resolution exports in PNG and JPEG formats, alongside broadcast-ready 60 FPS MP4 video animations, WebM, and animated GIFs optimized for all social platforms.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Plator exports for commercial work?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Everything you design and export inside Plator is 100% owned by you. You have full commercial rights for client projects, social media channels, product marketing, SaaS landing pages, and portfolio showcases.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which browsers and devices are supported?",
    answer:
      "Plator supports any modern browser with WebGL hardware acceleration enabled, including Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Arc across desktop, laptop, and tablet devices.",
  },
